# Elasticsearch Chef Cookbook

[![Cookbook Version](https://img.shields.io/cookbook/v/elasticsearch.svg)](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/elasticsearch)

**Please** review the [frequently asked questions](FAQ.md) and [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening issues or submitting pull requests.

## Looking for Elasticsearch 5.x or 6.x?

Please [check out the previous 3.x.x releases](https://github.com/elastic/cookbook-elasticsearch/tree/3.x.x) of this cookbook. Please consider pinning your cookbook to '~> 3.0' for support for Elasticsearch 6 and earlier, or '~> 4.0' release for Elasticsearch 6 and beyond.

## Resources

## Notifications and Service Start/Restart

The resources provided in this cookbook **do not automatically restart** services when changes have occurred. They ***do start services by default when configuring a new service*** This has been done to protect you from accidental data loss and service outages, as nodes might restart simultaneously or may not restart at all when bad configuration values are supplied.

elasticsearch_service has a special `service_actions` parameter you can use to specify what state the underlying service should be in on each chef run (defaults to `:enabled` and `:started`). It will also pass through all of the standard `service` resource
actions to the underlying service resource if you wish to notify it.

You **must** supply your desired notifications when using each resource if you want Chef to automatically restart services. Again, we don't recommend this unless you know what you're doing.

### Resource names

Many of the resources provided in this cookbook need to share configuration
values. For example, the `elasticsearch_service` resource needs to know the path
to the configuration file(s) generated by `elasticsearch_configure` and the path
to the actual ES binary installed by `elasticsearch_install`. And they both need
to know the appropriate system user and group defined by `elasticsearch_user`.

Search order: In order to make this easy, all resources in this cookbook use the following
search order to locate resources that apply to the same overall
Elasticsearch setup:

1. Resources that share the same resource name
1. Resources that share the same value for `instance_name`
1. Resources named `default` or resources named `elasticsearch`
   - This fails if both `default` and `elasticsearch` resources exist

Examples of more complicated resource names are left to the reader, but here we
present a typical example that should work in most cases:

```ruby
elasticsearch_user 'elasticsearch'
elasticsearch_install 'elasticsearch'
elasticsearch_configure 'elasticsearch'
elasticsearch_service 'elasticsearch'
elasticsearch_plugin 'x-pack'
```

### elasticsearch_user

Actions: `:create`, `:remove`

Creates a user and group on the system for use by elasticsearch. Here is an
example with many of the default options and default values (all options except
a resource name may be omitted).

Examples:

```ruby
elasticsearch_user 'elasticsearch'
```

```ruby
elasticsearch_user 'elasticsearch' do
  username 'elasticsearch'
  groupname 'elasticsearch'
  shell '/bin/bash'
  comment 'Elasticsearch User'

  action :create
end
```

### elasticsearch_install

Actions: `:install`, `:remove`

Downloads the elasticsearch software, and unpacks it on the system. There are
currently three ways to install -- `'repository'` (the default), which creates an
apt or yum repo and installs from there, `'package'`, which downloads the appropriate
package from elasticsearch.org and uses the package manager to install it, and
`'tarball'` which downloads a tarball from elasticsearch.org and unpacks it.
This resource also comes with a `:remove` action which will remove the package
or directory elasticsearch was unpacked into.

You may always specify a download_url and/or download_checksum, and you may
include `%s` which will be replaced by the version parameter you supply.

Please be sure to consult the above attribute section as that controls how
Elasticsearch version, download URL and checksum are determined if you omit
them.

**NOTE**: The `:remove` action has not been implemented yet. Pull requests are
very much welcome & encouraged, if you'd like to see this feature.

Examples:

```ruby
elasticsearch_install 'elasticsearch'
```

```ruby
elasticsearch_install 'my_es_installation' do
  type 'package'
  version '7.8.0'
  action :install
end
```

```ruby
elasticsearch_install 'my_es_installation' do
  type 'tarball'
  dir '/usr/local' # where to install

  download_url "https://download.elasticsearch.org/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-1.7.2.tar.gz"
  # sha256
  download_checksum "6f81935e270c403681e120ec4395c28b2ddc87e659ff7784608b86beb5223dd2"

  action :install
end
```

```ruby
elasticsearch_install 'my_es_installation' do
  type 'tarball'
  version '7.8.0'
  action :install # could be :remove as well
end
```

```ruby
elasticsearch_install 'my_es_installation' do
  type 'package' # type of install
  download_url "https://download.elasticsearch.org/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-1.7.2.deb"
  # sha256
  download_checksum "791fb9f2131be2cf8c1f86ca35e0b912d7155a53f89c2df67467ca2105e77ec2"
  instance_name 'elasticsearch'
  action :install # could be :remove as well
end
```

### elasticsearch_configure

Actions: `:manage`, `:remove`

Configures an elasticsearch instance; creates directories for configuration,
logs, and data. Writes files `log4j2.properties`, `elasticsearch.in.sh` and
`elasticsearch.yml`.

The main attribute for this resource is `configuration`,
which is a hash of any elasticsearch configuration directives. The
other important attribute is `default_configuration` -- this contains the
minimal set of required defaults.

Note that these are both *not* a Chef mash, everything must be in a single level
of keys and values. Any settings you pass in configuration will be merged into
(and potentially overwrite) any default settings.

See the examples, [as well as the attributes in the resource file](libraries/resource_configure.rb),
for more.

Examples:

With all defaults -

```ruby
elasticsearch_configure 'elasticsearch'
```

With mostly defaults -

```ruby
elasticsearch_configure 'elasticsearch' do
    allocated_memory '512m'
    configuration ({
      'cluster.name' => 'escluster',
      'node.name' => 'node01',
      'http.port' => 9201
    })
end
```

Very complicated -

```ruby
elasticsearch_configure 'my_elasticsearch' do
  # if you override one of these, you probably want to override all
  path_home     "/opt/elasticsearch"
  path_conf     "/etc/opt/elasticsearch"
  path_data     "/var/opt/elasticsearch"
  path_logs     "/var/log/elasticsearch"
  path_pid      "/var/run/elasticsearch"
  path_plugins  "/opt/elasticsearch/plugins"
  path_bin      "/opt/elasticsearch/bin"

  # override logging parameters
  cookbook_log4j2_properties "my_wrapper_cookbook"
  template_log4j2_properties "my_log4j2.properties.erb"

  logging({:"action" => 'INFO'})

  allocated_memory '123m'

  jvm_options %w(
                -XX:+UseParNewGC
                -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC
                -XX:CMSInitiatingOccupancyFraction=75
                -XX:+UseCMSInitiatingOccupancyOnly
                -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError
                -XX:+PrintGCDetails
              )

  configuration ({
    'node.name' => 'crazy'
  })

  action :manage
end
```

### elasticsearch_service

Actions: `:configure`, `:remove`

Writes out a system service configuration of the appropriate type, and enables
it to start on boot. You can override almost all of the relevant settings in
such a way that you may run multiple instances. Most settings will be taken from
a matching `elasticsearch_config` resource in the collection.

```ruby
elasticsearch_service 'elasticsearch'
```

**Restart Configuration**

You can configure systemd restart behavior using the `restart_policy` and `restart_sec` properties:

```ruby
elasticsearch_service 'elasticsearch' do
  restart_policy 'on-failure'    # Restart only on failure
  restart_sec 30                 # Wait 30 seconds before restart
end
```

```ruby
elasticsearch_service 'elasticsearch' do
  restart_policy 'always'        # Always restart
  restart_sec '5min'             # Wait 5 minutes before restart
end
```

Valid restart policies:
- `''` (empty string) - No automatic restart (default, maintains backward compatibility)
- `'no'` - Never restart
- `'always'` - Always restart regardless of exit status
- `'on-success'` - Restart only when process exits cleanly
- `'on-failure'` - Restart when process exits with non-zero code, killed by signal, timeout, or watchdog
- `'on-abnormal'` - Restart when process is terminated by signal, timeout, or watchdog
- `'on-abort'` - Restart when process exits due to uncaught signal
- `'on-watchdog'` - Restart when watchdog timeout occurs

The `restart_sec` property accepts either an integer (seconds) or a systemd time span string (e.g., "5min", "30s", "1m 30s").

If you'd like to skip init scripts and systemd scripts, simply pass `nil` for
the template file (init_source or systemd_source) and this cookbook will
entirely skip trying to setup those scripts. Combined with changing the default
service actions, this will have the same effect as `action :nothing`.

### elasticsearch_plugin

Actions: `:install`, `:remove`

Installs or removes a plugin to a given elasticsearch instance and plugin
directory. Please note that there is currently no way to upgrade an existing
plugin using commandline tools, so we haven't exposed that feature here either.
Furthermore, there isn't a way to determine if a plugin is compatible with ES or
even what version it is. So once we install a plugin to a directory, we
generally assume that is the desired one and we don't touch it further.

See <https://github.com/elastic/cookbook-elasticsearch/issues/264> for more info.
NB: You [may encounter issues on certain distros](http://blog.backslasher.net/java-ssl-crash.html) with NSS 3.16.1 and OpenJDK 7.x.

Officially supported or commercial plugins require just the plugin name:

```ruby
elasticsearch_plugin 'analysis-icu' do
  action :install
end
elasticsearch_plugin 'shield' do
  action :install
end
```

Plugins from GitHub require a URL of 'username/repository' or 'username/repository/version':

```ruby
elasticsearch_plugin 'kopf' do
  url 'lmenezes/elasticsearch-kopf'
  action :install
end

elasticsearch_plugin 'kopf' do
  url 'lmenezes/elasticsearch-kopf/1.5.7'
  action :install
end
```

Plugins from Maven Central or Sonatype require 'groupId/artifactId/version':

```ruby
elasticsearch_plugin 'mapper-attachments' do
  url 'org.elasticsearch/elasticsearch-mapper-attachments/2.6.0'
  action :install
end
```

Plugins can be installed from a custom URL or file location as follows:

```ruby
elasticsearch_plugin 'mapper-attachments' do
  url 'http://some.domain.name//my-plugin-1.0.0.zip'
  action :install
end

elasticsearch_plugin 'mapper-attachments' do
  url 'file:/path/to/my-plugin-1.0.0.zip'
  action :install
end
```

The plugin resource respects the `https_proxy` or `http_proxy` (non-SSL)
[Chef settings](https://docs.chef.io/config_rb_client.html) unless explicitly
disabled using `chef_proxy false`:

```ruby
elasticsearch_plugin 'kopf' do
  url 'lmenezes/elasticsearch-kopf'
  chef_proxy false
  action :install
end
```

To run multiple instances per machine, an explicit `plugin_dir` location
has to be provided:

```ruby
elasticsearch_plugin 'x-pack' do
  plugin_dir '/usr/share/elasticsearch_foo/plugins'
end
```

If for some reason, you want to name the resource something else, you may
provide the true plugin name using the `plugin_name` parameter:

```ruby
elasticsearch_plugin 'xyzzy' do
  plugin_name 'kopf'
  url 'lmenezes/elasticsearch-kopf'
  action :install
end
```
